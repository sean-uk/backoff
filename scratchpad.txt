<?php
// we know: 
//      the current page: the last one we sent to the client
//      the request page: ie; the page from the history pop
//      the nav history: the pages they've been on previously. this is NOT the browser history stack

// head 3 browser backing on to 2
current 3
request 2
nav_history [1,2,3]
// can map 3=>2 onto a backstep

// done 3, form back to 2, browser 'back' to 3
current 2
request 3
nav_history [1,2,3,2]
// 2=>3 maps onto a forward step

// the above, then browser 'forward' back to 2
current 3
request 2
nav_history [1,2,3,2,3]
// 3=>2 maps onto a backstep

// the above, then form forward back to 3
current 2
request 'forward'
nav_history [1,2,3,2,3,2]

// so the procedure i think to be this:
//  if no direction is supplied, take the last two steps from the nav history,
//  in reverse order to get the direction.
//  ... return the page for that, or stay where they are and wait for a backstep
